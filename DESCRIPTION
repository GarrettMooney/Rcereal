Description: cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library.
  cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into
  different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML,
  or JSON. cereal was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy
  to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily
  bundled with other code or used standalone.
